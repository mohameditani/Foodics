Process Chaining (Bolts, Promise): I used PromiseKit as process chaining framework. It was used for api handling.

Delegate & protocols: used in displaying categories & products data + delegate on product selection

Data Persistence: NSKeyarchiver where I stored the response object to it matching api url

OOP : Inheritance, Interface ...

JSON : Used in data parsing on the api level

Error Handling : alerts + related to the first point

Design Patterns: Singleton for the api & data manager , facade in mbprogresshud & sd_webimage
